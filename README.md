# COVID19-Global-Forecasting
This work started with a series of [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1) launched by Kaggle in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.  
Week 4 competition was the last of the series, I resumed my work by using source data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).  
The goal is to forecast confirmed cases and fatalities for the next 15 days in an attempt to help make estimates of the coming situation.  
The base model is ARIMA, it can be further improved by adding exogenous variables such as temperature
